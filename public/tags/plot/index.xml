      <description>Abstract In this report, we investigate whether subsidizing low-income childcare for age 0-5 children can meaningfully improve long-term educational outcomes (as measured by grade 9 graduation rates) as measured at a neighborhood-level.
 Introduction A question involving assistive funding for early-aged children is whether subsidized child-care can improve long-term educational outcomes. If such a relationship can be found, then educational decision makers may wish to further fund early childcare. If such a relationship doesnâ€™t exist, then funding which is purely for educational purposes may be better directed towards other facilities and services.</description>
